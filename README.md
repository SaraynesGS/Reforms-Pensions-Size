# Reform effects on private pension size in OECD countries 

Pension systems across the OECD area are diverse and complex, reflecting both statutory and private provisions that have significant implications for economic sustainability and political economy. As of the end of 2022, pension plan assets within OECD countries amounted to USD 51.5 trillion. In some countries, mandatory or quasi-mandatory plans cover over 75% of the working-age population, while in others, voluntary plans reach over 40% of this demographic. However, a comprehensive repository documenting the reforms affecting these private pensions does not exist. This study, therefore, examines the intricate nature of these systems and their reforms, focusing particularly on investment, taxes, and coverage.

Our research evaluates the evolution and impact of private pension reforms on pension fund assets, which are recognized as important indicators of financial strength and economic influence. By analyzing 446 parametric private pension reforms across 35 OECD countries from 2005 to 2020, the study zeroes in on three reform areas: expanding tax reliefs, increasing coverage, and relaxing investment constraints.

## Key Questions:
- How have reform efforts influenced the asset size of private pensions?
- What role does the persistence mechanism play in reinforcing the financial power of pension funds?

## Methodology
Utilizing a dynamic panel model, our analysis captures the short-term effects of these reforms on private pension assets. Special emphasis is placed on understanding the persistence mechanism, which reflects the enduring influence pension funds exert over financial markets.

## Key Findings
- Investments and Tax Reforms: Demonstrated to significantly increase private pension assets, confirming the financial strategiesâ€™ effectiveness in enhancing pension funds' strength.
- Coverage Expansion: Showed varied impact, requiring further exploration to understand its comprehensive effects.
